# Comu-Website
Html &amp; Css

The Comu-Website repository by krishna-mfai-ad is a simple web project built using HTML and CSS. It includes files and folders for images, logos, and public assets, as well as a home page (home.html) styled with a CSS file (home.css). The project appears to be a basic website template, potentially for a community or informational site.
